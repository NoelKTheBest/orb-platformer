# orb-platformer
A complete 2D platformer experience to be released on various platforms including itch.io, Steam, and the play store


I still do not have a name for the game yet nor a project timeline. Still in the prototyping phase of testing out my mechanics in a 2D platformer environment. I find that these types of games are easiest to work with. I had another idea like this, but that game was going to be one where the player could move between 2 different gravity zones.

My goal here is to simply try making a game about doing combos that trades in melee attacks for projectiles. I though that maybe it could be easier to design or at least be another way to have fun doing combos. It may be helpful for each projectile to have various effects.
