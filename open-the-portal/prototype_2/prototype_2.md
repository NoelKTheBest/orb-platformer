# Prototype 2

## Goal
The goal will be to get to the end of the level and defeat the remote controller of the forcefield

## Obstacle
Enemies will be the main obstacle in your path that keep you from progressing if you don't know how to deal with them

### Next Obstacles
- Important enemies jump to avoid attacks
- Enemies block attacks
  #### Potential Obstacles
  - Enemies resist the anti-gravity effect (still launched slightly) 
  - Enemies don't get launched and are able to more easily hit you

## Main Ability
Shoot bullets at enemies

### Next Abilities
- Player can jump to hit the enemies in the air
- Player can shoot an anti-gravity shockwave at ground launching enemies in the air for a few seconds
  #### Potential Abilities
  - Player can charge shockwave for a bigger blast

## Limitation
The player can only fire x amount of shots in rapid succession before they can shoot anymore and if they hit their limit they may need to wait for a bit

### Next Limitations
- The player can only cycle fire while in the air (might only be one button press)
- Has cooldown and player has limited movement movement in air and is also launched with small ability to influence trajectory and movement (If hit in this mode, player get's launched until anti-gravity wave ends or they fall out of range of the attack)
  #### Potential Limitations
  - Player has a longer cooldown
